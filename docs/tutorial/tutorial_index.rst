Tutorials
=========

**These pages are currently under development.** However, the
material so far in place should be usable.

This page contains tutorials for programmers wanting to use the
**resqpy** RESQML application programming interface (API).
RESQML is the standard format for storing subsurface models. The
resqpy API is a Python library providing classes and functions
allowing application code to work with RESQML datasets at a
high level.

Whilst reading through a tutorial, it is recommended
that you have a Python interpreter (or Jupyter notebook) open
in another window, so that code snippets can be cut, pasted and
executed whilst progressing through the material.
