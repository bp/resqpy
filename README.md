## Introduction

resqpy is a pure Python package which provides a programming interface (API) for
reading, writing, and modifying reservoir models in the RESQML format. It gives
you the ability to work with reservoir models programmatically, without having
to know the details of the RESQML standard.

The package is written and maintained by bp, and is made available under the MIT
license as a contribution to the open-source community.

resqpy was created by Andy Beer. For enquires about resqpy, please contact
Nathan Lane (Nathan.Lane@bp.com)

### Documentation

See the complete package documentation on
[readthedocs](https://resqpy.readthedocs.io/).

### About RESQML

RESQMLâ„¢ is an industry initiative to provide open, non-proprietary data exchange
standards for reservoir characterization, earth and reservoir models. It is
governed by the [Energistics
consortium](https://www.energistics.org/portfolio/resqml-data-standards/).

Resqpy provides specialized classes for a subset of the RESQML high level object
classes, as described in the docs. Furthermore, not all variations of these
object types are supported; for example, radial IJK grids are not yet catered
for, although the RESQML standard does allow for such grids.

It is envisaged that the code base will be expanded to include other classes of
objects and more fully cover the options permitted by the RESQML standard.

Modification functionality at the moment focuses on changes to grid geometry.

## Installation

Resqpy can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install resqpy

Alternatively, to install your working copy of the code in "editable" mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e /path/to/working/copy

## Contributing

Contributions of all forms are welcome and encouraged! See the [Contributing
Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.rst) for guidance on how you can contribute, including
bug reports, features requests and pull requests.

### Repository structure

- `resqpy`: high level modules providing classes for main RESQML object types
  and high level modification functions
- `resqpy/olio`: low level modules, not often imported directly by calling code
- `tests`: unit tests
- `example_data`: small example datasets

### Unit tests

Run the test suite locally with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Making a release

To make a release at a given commit, simply make a git tag:

```bash
# Make a tag
git tag -a v0.0.1 -m "Incremental release with some bugfixes"

# Push tag to github
git push origin v0.0.1
```

The tag must have the prefix `v` and have the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
