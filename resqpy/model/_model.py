              calling the create_root(), create_rels_part() and create_doc_props() methods; if None, defaults

           create_hdf5_ref (boolean, optional): if True and new_epc is True and create_basics is True
              and epc_file is not None, then an hdf5 external part is created, equivalent to calling the
              create_hdf5_ext() method; an empty hdf5 file is also created; if None, defaults to same
