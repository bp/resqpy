              if False, a simple (unmasked) numpy array is returned

        returns:
           numpy array of shape (nh, nj, ni, 2, 2, 3) where nh = max_k0 - min_k0 + 1, being corner point x,y,z values
           for horizon corners (h, j, i, jp, ip) where h is the horizon (layer interface) index in the range
           0 .. max_k0 - min_k0

        notes:
           data for horizon max_k0 is included in the result (unlike with python ranges);
           in the case of a grid with k gaps, the horizons points returned will follow the k indexing of the points data
           and calling code will need to keep track of the min_k0 offset when using k_raw_index_array to select a slice
           of the horizons points array
