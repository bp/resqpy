       epc_file (string): file name to rewrite the model's xml to; if source grid is None, model is loaded from this file
       source_grid (grid.Grid object, optional): if None, the epc_file is loaded and it should contain one ijk grid object
          (or one 'ROOT' grid) which is used as the source grid
       pivot_xyz (triple float): a point in 3D space on the pivot axis, which is horizontal and orthogonal to azimuth
       azimuth: the direction of tilt (orthogonal to tilt axis), as a compass bearing in degrees
       dip: the angle to tilt the grid by, in degrees; a positive value tilts points in direction azimuth downwards (needs checking!)
       store_displacement (boolean, default False): if True, 3 grid property parts are created, one each for x, y, & z
          displacement of cells' centres brought about by the tilting
       inherit_properties (boolean, default False): if True, the new grid will have a copy of any properties associated
          with the source grid
       inherit_realization (int, optional): realization number for which properties will be inherited; ignored if
          inherit_properties is False
       inherit_all_realizations (boolean, default False): if True (and inherit_realization is None), properties for all
          realizations will be inherited; if False, only properties with a realization of None are inherited; ignored if
          inherit_properties is False or inherit_realization is not None
       new_grid_title (string): used as the citation title text for the new grid object
       new_epc_file (string, optional): if None, the source epc_file is extended with the new grid object; if present,
          a new epc file (& associated h5 file) is created to contain the tilted grid (& crs)
